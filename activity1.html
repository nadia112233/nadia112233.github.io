    <h2>Exploring Features!</h2>
    <p class="main-paragraph">In this section, we will explore some of the features of living things.
        Below there is a collection of six cards with pictures of both living and non-living things. 
        First think about whether the thing in the picture is living or non-living.
        Flip the cards over by putting your cursor on them to reveal the features of the thing in the picture. 
        Try to think about the common features that living things have and then the common features 
        that non-living things have. Once you are done with all the cards, scroll down and answer the questions below.
        <span class="blue-text">(ST1-4LW-S & ST1-1WS-S) Students have an opportunity to engage in a process of inquiry to
          determine the external features of living things.

            <p>The sun can move in the sky. It emits light. It does not need any food or drink.

            <p>Trees can grow and their growth also helps their branches move to absorb more sunlight. 
                They need water and nutrients from the soil. You can also harvest seeds from the fruit of trees and 
                plant them to get more trees! Are trees living or non-living?

                They also can not have babies. Cars can also make sounds just like cats! Is it living or non-living?
